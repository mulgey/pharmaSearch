For demonstration
1) "Cost effectiveness analysis of meropenem dose optimisation in critical patients -- "administrative"
2) "Use of oseltamivir in the treatment of influenza A" -- "instutional" 2 hospitals - 251 patients
3) "Switching to equivalent alternatives: antiretroviral optimisation strategy" - "costAnalysis" - says: optimisation but not "cost"
4) "Changing from cobicistat to a ritonavir boosted regimen in HIV positive patients" -- "outpatient" switch is being made for outpatients, not in the wards
5) Test: Retrospective studies for the end-of-life patients
6) "Evaluation of a pharmaceutical care programme for patients being treated with omalizumab" -- "selfmedication" under the stated Phar.Programme

9) "Preliminary design of hospital telepharmacy" -- there is no "telepharmacy"
10) "Nutritional risk evaluation in institutionalised elderly patients in a public nursing home" -- there's "intervention" but not stated in the title
