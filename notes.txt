For search demonstration
1) "Cost effectiveness analysis of meropenem dose optimisation in critical patients -- "administrative"
2) "Use of oseltamivir in the treatment of influenza A" -- "instutional" 2 hospitals - 251 patients
3) "Switching to equivalent alternatives: antiretroviral optimisation strategy" - "costAnalysis" - says: optimisation but not "cost"
4) "Changing from cobicistat to a ritonavir boosted regimen in HIV positive patients" -- "outpatient" switch is being made for outpatients, not in the wards
5) Test: Retrospective studies for the end-of-life patients
6) "Evaluation of a pharmaceutical care programme for patients being treated with omalizumab" -- "selfmedication" under the stated Phar.Programme
7) Artificial intelligence fails: "Pharmaceutical interventions in drugs provided to the outpatient hospital pharmacy" -- text contains "oncology" but can't be listed in Oncology
8) In doubt: "Analysis of antibiotic consumption in a nursing home" .. "antimicrobial stewardship programmes are necessary" it says so should I add the "stewardship" key?
9) "Preliminary design of hospital telepharmacy" -- there is no "telepharmacy"
10) "Nutritional risk evaluation in institutionalised elderly patients in a public nursing home" -- there's "intervention" but not stated in the title
11) "Prevalence of nutritional complications according to the requested hospitalisation service of total parenteral nutrition" -- oncology ward but it's about "nutrition"

For examples demonstration
1) "habits" for "AIDS"
<<<<<<< HEAD
2) "biosimilars" for "Rituximab" maybe plus "costAnalysis"

"advantages demonstration" for in-promotion
